# htmlPortfolio

A template artists can use to create and host their own portfolio websites. This template uses HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.

Users should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, however the basic template is very very simple and easy for beginners.

## JavaScript

This template uses JavaScript for one purpose: generating the header (with title and navigation links) and the footer on each page. This allows users to easily update links on their website by editing one file, instead of editing links of multiple html pages.

Users are encouraged to edit that JavaScript file (especially to add, remove, or edit navigation links). The navigation links will wrap, so put as many links as you'd like, it won't break the site.
